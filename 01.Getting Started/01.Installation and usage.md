# Installation and Usage

## Installation

To install via NPM:

```bash
npm i --save finnlp
```

## Usage

Example:

```javascript
// require the module
const fin = require("finnlp");

// instantiate new input
let processed = new fin("This is a some text");
```

### Processing

The processing of the input `This is some text` is done right when you instantiate, if you `console.log` the `processed` instance variable, you'll get something like this:

```javascript
{
  "input": "This is some text",
  "sentences": ["This is some text"],
  "result": [
    {
      "raw": "This is some text",
      "tokens": ["This","is","some","text"],
      "confidence": 90,
      "tags": ["DT","VBZ","DT","NN"],
      "deps": [
        {
          "label": "NSUBJ",
          "type": "NP",
          "master": 1
        },
        {
          "label": "ROOT",
          "type": "VP",
          "master": -1
        },
        {
          "label": "MWE",
          "type": "NP",
          "master": 3
        },
        {
          "label": "ATTR",
          "type": "NP",
          "master": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


### Detectors

**Fin**, by it's core, doesn't have any detectors, but if you installed any, it should be available as a method of the instance.

Example:

```javascript
const fin = require("finnlp");
// extending Fin
fin.extend(require("fin-spelling-variations"));
let processed = new fin("I like this colour.");
var britSpellings = processed.findBritishSpelling();
console.log(britSpellings);
```
Might give this log:

```
["colour"]
```

> __HINT__
> The above example is for demonstration purposes only, it shows how detectors can be installed and applied. Refer to [this page](./available-extensions.html) for all the detectors (and other extensions) that are currently available and maintained by the core developer.
