# Cloning and Contributing

## About this Project

You can notice that the [core library](https://github.com/FinNLP/fin/blob/master/index.js) is less than 100 lines long. This is because the development of this project takes a highly modular approach where everything is a module and loosely tied to the other.

So each of the lexicon, lexer, POS tagger, dependency parser is on a separate repository.

This helps in writing more eloquent tests, while keeping everything separate. And it should also help quite a lot if a second language implemented.


## How to contribute

### Cloning

- You can find all of the modules in [GitHub](https://github.com/FinNLP/)
- Most of the module rely on [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as a unit testing framework
- Executing `mocha test/test` should run the tests.


### Guidelines and Hints

- This project adheres to semantic versioning.
- Processing modules major version number corresponds to the core library's major version number. That means when the core library has the version `2.x.x`, all of it's modules should hold the version `2.x.x`.
- Write and run tests before sending the pull request.
- Read the documentation of the module in question.
