# Available Extensions

## Detectors

#### Emphasis
Detects the emphasis (if any on each token). Based on a dictionary of emphasis tokens and the dependency parser.

- [Installation and Usage](https://github.com/FinNLP/fin-emphasis)


#### Negation
Detects if the a token is negated, such as adjectives, adverbs, verbs ... etc. It's based on a dictionary and the dependency parser.

- [Installation and Usage](https://github.com/FinNLP/fin-negation)


#### Sentiment

Detects token negative and positive sentiments. For example `That was a good show`, the token `show` have a positive sentiment. Each token is given numerical value representing it's sentiment, when the number is negative the sentiment is negative such as `that was a bad show`, when the number is positive the sentiment is positive, and when it's `0` then the sentence doesn't have a sentiment description of the token.

- [Installation and Usage](https://github.com/FinNLP/fin-sentiment)

#### Sentence Type

Each sentence might be declarative, exclamatory, interrogative or imperative, This detector tries to analyze the sentence and gives the sentence type based on the tokens, tags and dependency tree.

- [Installation and Usage](https://github.com/FinNLP/fin-sentence-type)

#### URLs and Emails

When a sentence has emails, URLs or IP addresses it might mess up the lexer thus both of the POS tagger and dependency parser will give inaccurate results. This detector will add a pre and post processors that makes the lexer treats them as one word.

In addition to that, it can be also used detect URLs, emails and IP addresses.

- [Installation and Usage](https://github.com/FinNLP/fin-urls)

#### UK-US Spelling variations

This detector will analyze the given sentence and gives whether it has a UK or US specific spelling variation.

It will also gives a UK/US specific variation when it's applicable.

- [Installation and Usage](https://github.com/FinNLP/fin-ukus)

#### Sentence Tense

Detecting the exact tense of a given sentence.

## Post/PreProcessors

#### Slang

The provided POS tagger doesn't play nicely with internet slang. This pre processor will normalize those slangs into a bit more formal tokens. For example `w/o` will be converted to `without` and `gr8` will be converted to `great`.

- [Installation and Usage](https://github.com/FinNLP/fin-slang)

#### HTML entities

When you're accepting data from the internet this data might be escaped. For example the greater than sign `>` might be presented as `&gt;`. This will cause inaccuracies in the lexer and thus the POS tagger and the dependency parser. This preprocessor will treat all the HTML entities converting them into their normal form.

## Additional Tools

Following tools aren't really extensions to the __Fin__ natural language processor but they might be useful to you when authoring extensions.

#### Inflectors

This library can be used for english language inflections.

- Converting one form of a verb to other forms (present to past participle and such).
- Detecting whether a given noun is plural or singular.
- Converting from plural to singular and vice versa.
- Transforming adjectives to comparative and superlatives.

When looking for a library that provides the above solutions it's highly recommended to use this one, as it has been thoroughly tested and built to be very accurate.

- [Installation and Usage](https://github.com/finnlp/en-inflectors)


#### Stemmer

Stems a token to it's root form. It's basically a TypeScript implementation of the porter stemmer.

- [Installation and Usage](https://github.com/FinNLP/en-stemmer)


#### Spelling Variations

Give the spelling variations of a given token and whether it's a UK or US spelling variation.

- [Installation and Usage](https://github.com/FinNLP/strdistance)
