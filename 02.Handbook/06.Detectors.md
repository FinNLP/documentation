# Detection


## Introduction

Detectors are a higher level analysis functions that run on top of processors to get a more curated and specific results. Technically, any function that utilize and analyse the tokens, POS tags, and/or dependencies can be considered a detector.

Typically, detector function should be added to the `Fin.Run` function prototype. So whenever a new instance is created the detector function can be applied on the processing result which resides on the context (`this` object) of the instance.

The reason that __Fin__ has been designed to have it's detectors on the prototype, __not__ as part of the core processors, is that the detector function might cause performance issues. So you can call detector function only when you need them.


## Basic Example

A very basic example that will just return the number of sentences in a given instance.

### JavaScript

```javascript
import {Run} from "finnlp";
Run.prototype.sentencesCount = function () {
	return this.sentence.length;
}
```

### TypeScript

```typescript
import * as Fin from "finnlp";
declare module "finnlp" {
	export interface Run {
		sentencesCount: () => number;
	}
}

Fin.Run.prototype.sentencesCount = function (this:Fin.Run) {
	return this.sentences.length;
};

```

## More elaborate examples

I'm maintaining few useful detectors, have a look at them if you want more elaborate examples:
